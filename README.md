## Task 1: Personal Portfolio Website
*Objective:* Showcase skills and projects in a professional, multi-page website.

*Description:* This project involves creating a professional, multi-page personal portfolio website. The site is designed to be fully responsive, ensuring it looks great on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices. It includes three main sections accessible via a navigation bar: "About," "Projects," and "Contact."


## Task 2: To-Do List or Note-Taking App with Local Storage
*Objective:* Implement data persistence with local storage.

*Description:* I developed an interactive To-Do List or Note-Taking application that allows users to add, edit, and delete tasks or notes. The key feature of this app is its use of local storage for data persistence. This means that a user's tasks are automatically saved in their browser and are still available even if they close the browser or refresh the page.

## Task 3: Product Listing Page with Filtering and Sorting Options
Objective: Create interactive interfaces that allow users to filter and sort data.

*Description:* For this task, I built a dynamic product listing page that is designed for e-commerce or a catalog. The page features an intuitive interface where users can easily find products based on their specific needs.
